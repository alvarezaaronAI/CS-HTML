		Martin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 to April 4, 1968) was an American
		Baptist minister, activist, humanitarian, and leader in the African-American
		Civil Rights Movement. He is best known for his role in the advancement of
		civil rights using nonviolent civil disobedience based on his Christian beliefs.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		King became a civil rights activist early in his career. He led the 1955 Montgomery
		Bus Boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) 
		in 1957, serving as its first president. With the SCLC, King led an unsuccessful
		1962 struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia (the Albany Movement), and 
		helped organize the 1963 nonviolent protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King also
		helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous 
		"I Have a Dream" speech. There, he established his reputation as one of the greatest
		orators in American history.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		On October 14, 1964, King received the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial 
		inequality through nonviolence. In 1965, he helped to organize the Selma to Montgomery
		marches, and the following year he and SCLC took the movement north to Chicago to work
		on segregated housing. In the final years of his life, King expanded his focus to 
		include poverty and speak against the Vietnam War, alienating many of his liberal 
		allies with a 1967 speech titled "Beyond Vietnam".
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called 
		the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee.
		His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities.
	</p>
	<p>
		King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional
		Gold Medal. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established as a holiday in numerous cities
		and states beginning in 1971, and as a U.S. federal holiday in 1986. Hundreds of streets
		in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and a county in Washington State was also
		renamed for him. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington,
		D.C., was dedicated in 2011.
