	Abraham Lincoln ( February 12, 1809 to April 15, 1865) was the 16th 
	President of the United States, serving from March 1861 until his 
	assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through
	its Civil War—its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional,
	and political crisis.[1][2] In doing so, he preserved the Union, 
	abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized
	the economy.

	Born in Hodgenville, Kentucky, Lincoln grew up on the western frontier
	in Kentucky and Indiana. Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in
	Illinois, a Whig Party leader, and a member of the Illinois House of
	 Representatives, in which he served for twelve years. Elected to the
	 United States House of Representatives in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid
	 modernization of the economy through banks, tariffs, and railroads.
	 Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress,
	 and because his opposition to the Mexican–American War was unpopular 
	 among Illinois voters, Lincoln returned to Springfield and resumed
	 his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became
	 a leader in building the new Republican Party, which had a statewide
	 majority in Illinois. In 1858, while taking part in a series of highly
	 publicized debates with his opponent and rival, Democrat Stephen A.
	 Douglas, Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost
	 the U.S. Senate race to Douglas.

	In 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination
	 as a moderate from a swing state. With very little support in the 
	 slaveholding states of the South, he swept the North and was elected
	 president in 1860. His victory prompted seven southern slave states 
	 to form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the
	 White House - no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding
	 slavery and secession. Subsequently, on April 12, 1861, a Confederate
	 attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to enthusiastically rally
	 behind the Union in a declaration of war. As the leader of the moderate
	 faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical 
	 Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats,
	 who called for more compromise, anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads),
	 who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his 
	 assassination. Politically, Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents
	 against each other, by carefully planned political patronage, and by
	 appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.[3] His 
	 Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of the principles of
	 nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy.

	Lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions
	 of the war. His primary goal was to reunite the nation. He suspended
	 habeas corpus, leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision,
	 and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the
	 Trent Affair in late 1861. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, 
	 especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful
	 general, Ulysses S. Grant. He also made major decisions on Union war
	 strategy, including a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal
	 trade, moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and using 
	 gunboats to gain control of the southern river system. Lincoln tried 
	 repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond; each time a
	 general failed, Lincoln substituted another, until finally Grant succeeded.
	 As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included
	 the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to 
	 protect escaped slaves, encouraged the border states to outlaw slavery
	 , and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United 
	 States Constitution, which permanently outlawed slavery.

 <p>
	An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in
	 each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own 
	 re-election campaign in the 1864 presidential election. Anticipating the
	 war's conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of Reconstruction, 
	 seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous 
	 reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. On April
	 14, 1865, five days after the April 9th surrender of Confederate 
	 commanding general Robert E. Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by John 
	 Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer.

 <p>
	Lincoln has been consistently ranked both by scholars[4] and the
	 public[5] as one of the three greatest U.S. presidents.
