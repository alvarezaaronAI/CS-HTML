	a) 
	One syntax problem is that under <tbody> theres no closing statement
 	that close <tbody>.
	b)
	Theres a second friendly in the table. In the end<td>Osaka</td>
                   					 <td>None</td>
                    					 <td>Hostile</td>
                 				         <td>None</td>
                 				         <td>Friendly</td>
                 				         <td>Friendly</td>
	The friendly does not go witt any table above causing it to go out of the 
	table imaginary border. Either it has to be taken out or ad another colum.

One problem in the syntax of css would be the body part.It will not display
 the background color which is supposed to be red for the reason that 
it was typed, (bgcolor) if you wanted background color you needed to write
(background-color: (thecoloryouwant).

One reason to choose HMTL5 for email input type than text input type is because 
when choosing email input type you can verify wheather the user has inputed the 
right information, in this case the right email address and not a random text.

Second reason its better is that you can organize it much better when it comes to
javascript and choosing what to do with the email adress rather then choosing all 
text inputs to do a certain thing, its easier for the coder to just modify the email
input type to do certain things for its websites.

The difference is that strong and em described its meaning not just typography like b and i

I would use css to make the content clickable in certain areas. Such as right part of the content
it would click and redirect you to the first person page, the center would also be clickable for the
middle person in the image and finally the left side of the content would be also clickable and 
would redirect you to the last guy on the left page.

Depending on the browser if you go to developer on the web browser and to web console and 
look at the incorrect sections that are usally red, it will tell you the 
cause such as " 'yourFunction' not defined " and it will tell you exactly 
where is not defined.

	a)
	This is an extertal script since its a file that is named functions.js
	The js is probably being link to the HTMl making this file ".js" a external
	b)
	To make it execute you would probably need a button in the html site and have 
	an attribute when clicked it would execute the function "welcome()"
