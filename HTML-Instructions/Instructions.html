				Woven Book Wallet
			<hr/>
		</h1>
	<!-- Introduction -->
		<p>
			<em>
				<b>
				This is a step by step on how to make your own Woven Book wallet from any book you want to recycle or through away. Its really cheap and affordable 
				definitely cool at the very end. I do recommend to get a book which you will no longer need to read (preferably recycled books) since you will need to 
				rip out the pages to make a woven wallet out of these pages. You must know how to weave in order to make the final product, if you don't know how to weave 
				recommend to please learn that first and then come back to the project.

			<b> Instructions </b> <br>
			<ol>
	<!-- Step 1 -->
				<li>
				Start by making the strips that you are going to weave by cuting out from one of the book pages. <br>The dimensioned are <i>3/4 by 5 inches</i> which you will be cuting out of the full page <i> 5 by 7 1/2 inches</i>. 
				</li>
				<br>
	<!-- Step 2 -->	
				<li>
				Next, fold the strip in half, then placed it on the clear packing tape. Fold the tape around the edges of the strip.<br> By doing this, the wallet will become more durable and will be water resistance.
				</li>
				<br>
	<!-- Step 3 -->
				<li>
				Next, I tap <i> 2</i> strips together creating a <i>90</i> degree angle.
				</li>
				<br>
	<!-- Step 4 -->	
				<li>
				Start weaving by taping one set onto the cutting board. Tape the other sets next to each other.<br> After doing this, weave the overlapping strips together.
				</li>
				<br>
	<!-- Step 5 -->	
				<li>
				After you finish weaving, clear tape one of the sides. Then trim down the sides so it becomes <i>8</i> by <i>3 inches</i>. <br>From the last <i> 2</i>book pages trim down the page to <i>7.5</i> by <i>3/4 inches</i>.Fold it in half and taped it to the edge of the woven strips.
				</li>
				<br>
	<!-- Step 6 -->	
				<li>
				Cut to sheets that are <i>7.5</i> by <i>3 inches</i>. Tap the two together creating a sheet that is <i>8 inches</i> long.
				</li>
				<br>
	<!-- Step 7 -->	
				<li>
				Next, make the pockets. Cut strips that were <i>7 1/2</i> by <i>1 1/2 inches</i>.Cover one side in tape and use that to attach it do the wallet.
				</li>
				<br>
	<!-- Step 8 -->	
				<li>
				Finally,start to attach the two sides of the wallet together. Cut strips that were <i>3/4 inch</i> wide,then cover one side in packing tape.<br>Leave a <i>1/4 inch</i> trim around the edge. Use this to attach it to the wallet.
				</li>
			</ol>
	<!-- Final Toughts -->	
			<p>
			<em>
				<b>
				Your final is finished right after you already have attached the pockets to the woven item you created in step <i> 4 </i> through <i> 5 </i>.
